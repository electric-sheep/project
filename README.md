#College Battle

It has been proven a long time ago that the most natural way humans learn is through play. For children this comes natural but as we grow up, we seem to forget this.

College Battle takes competitive massively-multiplayer online gaming and puts it into the context of schools. Teachers define questions, and students compete online in realtime for the best score.
